This project was created for the Klik2Learn Coding Challange.

:- The first part of the challenge I found simple enough, even without using HTML extensively or React.JS at all. This is the bottom version of the numbers and figures, aiming to be a recreation of the example HTML page.
  Total time = ~2 hours.
:- The third part was done in short order with help from online resources, although it just has basic functionality and doesn't work from the ideal prompt (successfully completing the game) it has the basics of what I believe you were looking for. 
  Total time = ~2 hours.
:- The second part of the challenge gave me the most difficulty and ultimately I was unsuccessful, without having a better understanding of the syntax of react.JS I was unable to put in the desired functionality from manipulating tutorials and documentation online. 
    :-- There was a great deal of trial and error, and I found that it was the syntax of logic and the construction of functions that were missing.
    :-- The way I was going about making the game functional was to have an array of the numbers and the figures, and use their index position (pre-shuffle) to determine if a match was made. 
    :-- During my attempts, I did get more proficient with the tools and ended up having a lot of duplicated code. This is why there is 2 version of the numbers and figures. the top one has the functionality that I did manage to implement for part two, including new numbers each time and on click selection.
  Total time = ~5 hours.
  
  
  I believe that with a little more time I would be able to get a hang of the syntax issues. Certainly by the start date of the internship I'll be much more profiecent in this software. 

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
